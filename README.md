# Shopping Cart Project

Welcome to the Shopping Cart project! This project is a robot store where you can shop for robots. The project was inspired by Ebenezer Don's Redux training on LinkedIn.

This project features the following functionalities:

- `addToCart`: This function allows you to add a selected robot to your shopping cart.
- `RemoveFromCart`: This function allows you to remove a selected robot from your shopping cart.
- `ClearAllItems`: This function allows you to clear all items from your shopping cart.

The project uses the `createAsyncThunk` for managing API calls.
